# Colliders and Debug.Log

## A New Useful Tool to help you out: Debug.Log!

Debug.Log is a class that is already built into the Unity Framework to help developers with debugging code.  It is a simple action that will print code to the Console Window that we tell it to.  It is similiar to Console.log() in JavaScript.  

### But first, what is the Console Window?

The Console Window (menu: **Window > Console**) is a seperate window that shows us errors, warnings and other messages that are created by Unity.  Code that we use Debug.Log in will show up here in the Console Window.  

### How to use it

In any script, the easiest way to show an example of Debug.Log is to use it in the void Start action.  This way it'll always show our Debug.Log message on start. 

This isn't the only use for it however, Debug.Log's main functionality is to help a developer debug so using it functions to figure out a compiling error is the best way for us to use it!
